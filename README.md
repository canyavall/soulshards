This project is only to check how to work with react-redux-firebase plugin and to check different tools and structures for data tables and forms.

Actually, only the tab resources is working and we can created delete and edit resources

To run it, you need a firebase account  with the table resources inside and then modify the file fbConfig inside the utils folder. When you have done it, everything should work fine.

Remember that in firebase you need to allow all users to use your fabase database, in the future I'll create the authentication process and start using it.
